<h2>Workshop: Moving Transparent Statistics Forward @CHI&nbsp;2017</h2>
<p><a href="http://mjskay.com/">Matthew&nbsp;Kay</a>, <a href="http://steveharoz.com/">Steve&nbsp;Haroz</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sguha/">Shion&nbsp;Guha</a>, <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~dragice/">Pierre&nbsp;Dragicevic</a>, 
and <a href="http://zpac.ch/chat">Chat&nbsp;Wacharamanotham</a></p>

<h3>Call for Participation</h3>                 
<p>HCI is large and multidisciplinary, drawing on a variety of statistical practices. 
However, many of these existing practices have drawn increasing criticism within both
HCI and related fields, including but not limited to: over reliance on particular 
statistical methods, a lack of transparent reporting, a lack of replication and meta-analysis,
few studies published with data or study materials, and inadequate education in statistics. 
These issues have even reached the popular press in coverage of the <em>replication crisis</em>
in social science.</p>

<p>We are running a <em>working</em> workshop to develop concrete guidelines for improving statistical 
practice in HCI. Participants will work in groups to flesh out guidelines for helping reviewers 
fairly assess statistical reports in CHI papers, concrete suggestions for changes, resources 
for authors, to review processes, and other relevant guidelines or proposals the group wishes 
to advance. We will seed writing with draft guidelines developed in the wake of last years’ 
<a href="http://www.transparentstatistics.org/chi2016"><abbr title="Special Interest Group">SIG</abbr> on 
Transparent Statistics in HCI</a>. However, we will not be constrained to the outline in these 
draft documents if discussions take us elsewhere.</p>

<p>These documents will be shared publicly once finalized and we will engage the CHI Executive 
Committee and/or Program Chairs to discuss the feasibility of suggested changes to the review 
process, and the possibility of incorporating some of the recommendations into official documents 
like the SIGCHI reviewer guidelines. We will also continue hosting and drafting future revisions 
of the documents on a collaborative editing platform.</p>

<p><strong>We are looking for a diverse set of perspectives on quantitative methods</strong> in the HCI community to 
develop these documents (while qualitative methods are important to HCI, our primary focus in this 
workshop is on improving the use and communication of quantitative work). If you are interested in 
improving the state of statistical practice in HCI&mdash;whether or not you attended last year’s 
SIG&mdash;submit a position statement (at most 2 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstracts format) containing:</p>

<ul>
<li>A short Bio (If there are multiple authors, only include a bio for the one author who wishes to attend).</li> 
<li>A statement of special areas of interest (in HCI, methods, statistics and/or statistical reporting).</li>
<li>A position statement on improving statistical communication or practice or a comment on our 
    <a href="/chi2016">statement on transparent statistics from CHI 2016.</a></li>
<li>An indication of which artifact(s) you are interested in contributing to from our 
    <a href="http://tinyurl.com/transparent-stats-docs">draft documents</a>, or a suggestion for 
    another artifact you believe should be included at the workshop.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Submit to <a href="mailto:chi2017workshop@transparentstatistics.org">chi2017workshop@transparentstatistics.org</a></strong>.
The final deadline for submission is <strong>Jan 14, 2017</strong>. If your ability to attend requires that you take advantage 
of a 2016 budget, you may submit by <strong>Dec 14, 2016</strong>. Unless a hard budget constraint is indicated, early submissions 
will be reviewed along with Jan 2017 submissions, so we can balance the diversity of participants’ backgrounds.</p>

<p>As much as we would like as many CHI researchers as possible to get involved in this initiative, we may not be 
able to accept all applicants due to limits in the number of attendees at CHI workshops. If this happens, we will 
select applications based on expertise, diversity of perspectives in quantitative methods, diversity of HCI domains, 
and diversity of interest in specific artifacts (to ensure we have people interested in working on each artifact). 
<strong>Our goal is that the participants reflect the diversity in quantitative methods, statistics, and domains across HCI.</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the position statement is to help us determine <em>specific</em> participants, so <strong>we encourage one 
author per position statement</strong>. Position statements with multiple authors should clearly indicate which author will 
attend. If your position statement is accepted, the attending author must register for both the workshop and at 
least one day of the conference.</p>
