<p>Transparent statistics is a philosophy of statistical reporting whose purpose is scientific 
advancement rather than persuasion. We ran a <abbr title="Special Interest Group">SIG</abbr> at 
<abbr title="Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems">CHI</abbr> 2016 to discuss problems and limitations in 
statistical practices in <abbr title="Humanâ€“Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> and options for moving the field towards clearer and more reliable 
ways of writing about experiments. Read our abstract below for more information (also available <a href="chi-2016-sig.pdf">as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<abbr>PDF</abbr></a>).</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for making our SIG a success!</strong> The turnout and enthusiasm was overwhelming! <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8SF-zy_7oe9Rk84R1BkeFFKQ2M&usp=sharing">Materials from the SIG are available here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Join our mailing list!</strong> We have started a <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/transparent-stats-hci">mailing list</a> to 
continue the conversation started at the <abbr>SIG</abbr>, with the goal of quickly developing some concrete recommendations to move the field forward.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Empirical studies in <abbr>HCI</abbr> typically consist of solitary experiments
analyzed through null hypothesis significance testing (<abbr>NHST</abbr>).
However, this traditional approach is under growing criticism at
<abbr>CHI</abbr>&nbsp;[<a href="#kaptein2012rethinking">11</a>,<a href="#cairns2007hci">3</a>,<a href="#dragicevic2016Fair">7</a>,<a href="#kay2016bayes">12</a>]
and has been strongly criticized for more than 50 years in other
fields&nbsp;[<a href="#kline2004beyond">13</a>,<a href="#cumming2013new">5</a>,<a href="#open2015estimating">4</a>].</p>

<p>Problems with current practices include&nbsp;[<a href="#dragicevic2016Fair">7</a>,<a href="#wilson2012replichi">14</a>,<a href="#kaptein2012rethinking">11</a>,<a href="#kay2016bayes">12</a>]:</p>

<ul>
<li>The use of statistical constructs (e.g, <i>p</i>-values) that most researchers have trouble grasping intuitively</li>
<li>Overemphasis on conveying evidence and numbers rather than useful information and generalizable conclusions, leading to tedious <i>p</i>-cluttered reports</li>
<li>Dichotomous thinking, i.e., thinking of hypotheses as either true or false, and of effects and evidence as either existing or not existing</li>
<li>Undisclosed flexibility in data analyses, yielding cherry-picked results or <i>p</i>-hacking (even if unintentional)</li>
<li>Simplistic criteria for paper acceptance (e.g., looking at whether results are "significant") leading to positive results bias, and thus an incomplete and distorted literature</li>
<li>A lack of focus on research as a cumulative and collective enterprise, including a lack of incentives for sharing experimental data and study materials, a lack of replication, and virtually no meta-analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Problems with statistics in <abbr>HCI</abbr> extend beyond mere procedural
mistakes committed by researchers who might need more statistical
training. We believe these are deeper issues worthy of a
conversation&mdash;here, a <abbr>SIG</abbr>&mdash;about how to reform the prevalent
methods in the community.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is Transparent Statistics?</h2>

<p>Our use of the term <em>transparent statistics</em> is not meant to
imply that statistical reports at <abbr>CHI</abbr> are necessarily opaque.
Instead, it aims to emphasize transparency in reporting. More
specifically, we propose to refer to transparent statistics as <em>a
	philosophy of statistical reporting whose purpose is to advance
	scientific knowledge rather than to persuade</em>. Although transparent
statistics recognizes that rhetoric plays a major role in scientific
writing&nbsp;[<a href="#abelson2012statistics">1</a>], it dictates that when
persuasion is at odds with the dissemination of clear and complete
knowledge, the latter should prevail. For example, when empirical
data provides incomplete or mixed evidence, a transparent
investigator should refrain from drawing definitive conclusions and
instead communicate all relevant information <em>&ldquo;in
	intelligible form, in recognition of the right of other free minds
	to utilize them in making their own decisions&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#fisher1955statistical">8</a>].
Transparent statistics puts clarity before messiness, and messiness
before false clarity&mdash;study results are often disappointingly
complex, but in transparent statistics the quest for scientific
truth prevails over <em>&ldquo;aesthetic criteria of novelty,
	narrative facility, and perfection&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#giner2012science">9</a>].</p>

<p>Acknowledging the messiness of results is often at odds with our
desire to make strong, definitive statements (<em>&ldquo;technique
	A outperforms technique B&rdquo;</em>). But conveying uncertainty more
faithfully represents our results and even makes them more useful:
practitioners do not want to know if <i>p</i> is less than .05; they
want to know by how much does technique A improve over technique B
(plus-or-minus some error) so that they can perform a cost-benefit
analysis and decide whether to adopt it. Besides advancing clarity
within our field, transparent statistics can help address another
existential crisis for <abbr>HCI</abbr>&mdash;impact on real-world
systems&mdash;by expressing our results in statistical language that
is amenable to assessing practical significance.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="how-to-move">How to Move Towards Transparent Statistics?</h2>

<p>The purpose of
this <abbr>SIG</abbr> meeting is to discuss how we can move toward more
transparent statistical practice in <abbr>HCI</abbr> and also what <abbr>HCI</abbr> can
contribute to broader statistical reform. We offer several discussion
points, ideas, and opinions to start that conversation.</p>

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting Transparent Statistics</h3>

<p>Transparent statistics are about both <em>what</em> we report and <em>how</em>
we report it. While methodologists have been discussing <em>what</em>
to report to maximize transparency (e.g, communicating
simple/standardized effect sizes with frequentist/Bayesian interval
estimates, clearly distinguishing between planned and unplanned
analyses), <abbr>HCI</abbr> can advance guidelines for <em>how</em> to report
transparent statistics in a user-friendly manner. For instance,
clear, straightforward graphical communication of effects can be
written into modern reporting guidelines&nbsp;[<a href="#dragicevic2016Fair">7</a>].
These approaches could become both the standard within <abbr>HCI</abbr> and the
standard we aspire to create through new statistical
tools&mdash;what if the output of any procedure in a statistical
package was an annotated, self-explanatory visualization, rather
than a cryptic table? This approach may make some uncomfortable, as
guidelines already exist that insist upon many orthodox practices
that can be harmful to transparent statistical communication. These
older standards lead to ubiquitous impenetrable results sections
that are peppered with numerical statistical results. We plan to
discuss how authors can educate reviewers when writing results that
do not follow old norms. This includes amassing a set of citations
that lend credence to (currently) unorthodox approaches; e.g.,
essays by advocates of estimation&nbsp;[<a href="#cumming2013new">5</a>,<a href="#dragicevic2016Fair">7</a>] and of Bayesian
methods&nbsp;[<a href="#kay2016bayes">12</a>].
</p>

<p>Having more papers in the field using these methods can also help.
Done well, these methods could speak for themselves. Clearer
communication (with relevant citations) can be enough to convince
reviewers simply through the deeper understanding they gain from the
work. However, some rethinking is still necessary: a wide confidence
interval that just overlaps 0 in a small-n study is more honest than
a <i>p</i> value just above .05 (and better informs future meta- or
Bayesian analysis), but might feel like a lackluster result to a
reviewer used to thinking in binary rejection criteria.
</p>

<h3 id="practical-sig">Emphasizing Practical Significance over Testing</h3>

<p>In contrast to a focus on binary testing (is A better than
B?), transparent statistics emphasize effect size (how much better?)
and uncertainty (what are the upper and lower bounds on the
difference?). These inform us on practical significance: is the
difference large enough, and are we certain enough to act on it?
Given an estimated difference between two conditions, a practitioner
could apply a cost function to decide whether the increase in
performance is worth the cost of switching to a new interface or
technique. Cost/benefit analysis, not statistical significance, is
the language of industry, and therefore one way for results from <abbr>HCI</abbr>
to make it out of the lab and into real-world systems.</p>

<h3 id="training">Training and Education</h3>

<p>Training and education is an important part of this debate.
Many <abbr>HCI</abbr> researchers learn statistics in one of two ways: through an
applied statistics course (for non-statisticians) taught by
statisticians, or through a course (or part of a course) taught by
an <abbr>HCI</abbr> or computer science professor in their home departments. The
latter approach can perpetuate old norms in the field which, as we
have argued, need to be reexamined and reformed. How can we better
integrate transparent statistics education into <abbr>HCI</abbr> curricula (as is
becoming more common in other fields)?</p>

<h3 id="open-data">Open Data and Replications</h3>

<p>While clear communication of statistical analyses is critical,
publishing the underlying data allows those analyses to be verified.
Open data allows readers to answer questions about aspects of
analysis that may be missing from the text. It also allows
subsequent researchers to analyze facets of the data that the
original researchers did not examine, perform meta analyses on
multiple publications, and more easily use existing data to form
priors for future Bayesian analyses. Science is a cumulative and
collective enterprise.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, questions have arisen regarding the costs and
merits of open data. Documenting and anonymizing data takes time.
There are also limits to its error-correcting ability. While
reexamination of an experiment's data can help detect mistakes,
problems can occur in any stage of an experiment, including
incorrect stimulus presentation, incorrect response recording, and
the possibility of a statistical fluke. Furthermore, reusing
materials can propagate these mistakes across multiple publications.
Overcoming these problems requires complete experiment
replication&nbsp;[<a href="#wilson2012replichi">14</a>], not just reproduction of the
analysis.</p>

<h3 id="transparent-con">Transparent Conclusions</h3>

<p>While our focus is on reporting and analysis, transparent
statistics necessarily go hand-in-hand with well-designed and
implemented experiments with reasonable conclusions. The conclusions
should be nuanced and not convey more certainty than the
results&nbsp;[<a href="#dragicevic2016Fair">7</a>]. Overgeneralizing results should
also be avoided. If a technique is beneficial in one implementation
or task&nbsp;[<a href="#haroz2012capacity">10</a>], how can theory be used to make
conclusions that extend beyond the narrow scope of the experiment?
How we write about generalizability typically follows uncodified
conventions that depend on whether the research took a
hypothesis-driven or data-driven approach&mdash;themselves direct
successors of deductive and inductive reasoning
[<a href="#dillon1996user">6</a>]. Failure to differentiate the two often
results in overclaiming about the external validity or
generalizability of human-centered research
[<a href="#bernstein2011trouble">2</a>]. Transparency is increased if research
projects describe (1) how they connect to and build off of existing
theories and (2) why or if the conclusions are externally valid.</p>

<h3 id="hci-can-help">HCI Can Help Statistics!</h3>

<p>Beyond advancing transparent statistics within our own field,
<abbr>HCI</abbr> can provide a unique voice in the ongoing conversation around
improving the usability of analysis tools and improving the clarity
of statistical communication. We can help improve cryptic
statistical systems that are hard to learn, require substantial
background to use, and even fail silently (returning incorrect
results to unwitting users).</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We propose a meeting at <abbr>CHI</abbr> to discuss the present and future
of transparent statistical communication in <abbr>HCI</abbr>, a conversation we
hope will improve the clarity, reliability, and impact of
quantitative results in the field.</p>
