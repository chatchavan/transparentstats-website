<h1>Transparent Statistics in Human–Computer Interaction</h1>
<p>Transparent statistics is a philosophy of statistical reporting whose purpose is scientific advancement rather than persuasion. We are interested in moving the field of <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> towards clearer and more reliable ways of writing about experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Join us!</strong> The best way to get involved is to <strong>join our Slack workspace</strong>—email <a href="mailto:core@transparentstatistics.org">core@transparentstatistics.org</a> and we’ll send you an invite. We also have a <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/transparent-stats-hci">mailing list</a> you can sign up for, but the Slack is more active.</p>
<p><strong>Read our statements and materials from CHI 2016, CHI 2017, and CHI 2018:</strong> We ran a <abbr title="Special Interest Group">SIG</abbr> on transparent statistics at <a href="/chi2016"><abbr>CHI</abbr> 2016</a>, a workshop at <a href="/chi2017"><abbr>CHI</abbr> 2017</a>, and another <abbr>SIG</abbr> at <a href="/chi2018"><abbr>CHI</abbr> 2018</a>.</p>
