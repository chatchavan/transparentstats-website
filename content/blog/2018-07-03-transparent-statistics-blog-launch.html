<p>This post marks the transition of the Transparent Statistics in HCI website to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>. This is an exciting transition for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The website is no longer backed by some hacked-together scripts I made.</li>
<li>The website can be contributed to by others via <a href="https://github.com/transparentstats/transparentstats-website">Github</a>.</li>
<li><strong>(Most excitingly)</strong>, we will be able to begin blogging about transparent statistics in HCI!</li>
</ol>
<p>To that last point, we will be soliciting posts from members of the community on topics related to transparent statistical communication in human-computer interaction. We also welcome volunteers: if there is something you would like to write about, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:core@transparentstatistics.org">core@transparentstatistics.org</a>! The inaugural post on the blog will be by the one and only <a href="http://dragice.fr/">Pierre Dragicevic</a>.</p>
<p>You can also follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/trans_stats_hci"><span class="citation">@trans_stats_hci</span></a> and using <a href="/blog/index.xml">RSS</a>.</p>
